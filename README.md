 <h1>LibreLoginProdigy 🔐 - autologin plugin</h1>
  <p>This (LibreLoginProdigy<b>igy</b>) is a temporary fork of LibreLoginProd which was a fork of the <b>LibreLogin</b> (previously LibrePremium). LibreLoginProd is no longer actively maintained (as the author stated) and the original LibreLogin did not meet our expectations, which is why this second fork was created.</p>

# FAQ

### What does «Prod» mean?
This means that the project is a heavily modified version intended for production use.

### Will the folder name change after installation?
No, we use the same folder and config names as original the **LibreLogin**.

### Will this fork be maintained?
Yes, we plan to maintain this fork and keep it updated with the latest Minecraft versions.
Though, we cannot guarantee long-term support and any new features.
Ultimately, you should consider using a more actively maintained plugin in the future like [NavAuth](https://github.com/Navio1430/NavAuth) (when it will be fully released).
